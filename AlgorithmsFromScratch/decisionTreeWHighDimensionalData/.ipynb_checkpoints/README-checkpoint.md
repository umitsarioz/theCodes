This project's aim is implement decision tree on high dimensional data. First of all, i examined the data. After that helping with CountVectorizer and tf-idf, i reduced dimension of data to extract better meanings and observations. Also it may be speed up of my algorithm. I used two different decision tree classifiers, one of them is fromscratchClassifier typed by me and other one is classifier in the scikit-learn lib. All details were given in the project_file.ipynb.
